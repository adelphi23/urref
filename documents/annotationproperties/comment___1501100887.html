Beliefs in a hypothesis is calculated as the sum of the masses of all sets it encloses. A belief function differs from a Bayesian probability model in that one does not condition on those parts of the evidence for which no probabilities are specified. This ability to explicitly model the degree of ignorance makes the theory very appealing and has been applied in areas such as inconsistency handling in OWL ontologies (Nikolov et al., 2007) and ontology mapping (e.g. Yaghlane and Laamari, 2007)."</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

It is important to point out that vague statements are truth-functional, that is, the degree of truth of a vague complex statement (which is constructed from elementary vague statements via logical operators) can be calculated from the degrees of truth of its constituents, while uncertain complex statements are generally not a function of the degrees of uncertainty of their constituents (Dubois and Prade, 1994)."</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>
